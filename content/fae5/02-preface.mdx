Future Art Ecosystems (FAE) is a project for building 21st century cultural infrastructure to support art and advanced technologies for the public good. Through research and development with a growing community of artists, technologists, policy-makers, researchers and fellow organisations, FAE develops insights, tools and projects that advance our mission. Embedded in Serpentine\'s Arts Technologies team, FAE facilitates the emergence of new systems for art, technology and society. Previous briefings on the metaverse, decentralised technologies and artificial intelligence have led to experimental development, prototyping alternative ownership systems for art and data governance for AI training.[^1]

The landscape of art and advanced technologies (AxAT) has undergone significant transformation over the past decade, with Creative R&D emerging as a distinct domain integrating artistic experimentation, technological innovation, and cross-sector collaborations. The fifth volume of the Future Art Ecosystems briefing series - Art x Creative R&D (FAE5) - examines this critical nexus and offers concrete proposals for its development and impact.

This publication comes at a pivotal moment as the UK Government develops its Industrial Strategy and Sector Plan for the Creative Industries.[^2] With technology and culture policy still in development, FAE5 presents a timely intervention to help shape these emerging priorities. The report offers policymakers a deeper understanding of AxAT\'s distinctive contribution to innovation ecosystems and the specific support structures needed to realise its full potential.

We are grateful to all the artists, researchers, technologists, policymakers and organisations who contributed their insights and expertise to this volume. Special thanks to our interview and roundtable participants who generously shared their experiences and perspectives. This work builds on Serpentine\'s decade-long commitment to supporting experimental practices at the intersection of art and technology and reflects our ongoing dedication to developing sustainable infrastructures for cultural innovation and for the public good.
