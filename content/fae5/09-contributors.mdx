**Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley**

works predominantly in animation, sound, performance and video game development with their main medium being the audience itself. The artist explores voices that (en)counter miss-representation, exclusion and mainstream erasure; with a focus on Black and Trans communities.

By engaging the visitor-player through most of their installations, Brathwaite-Shirley examines how individual choices are as critical as collective, political responsibility in the context of marginalisation. Brathwaite-Shirley's work has been presented internationally, with recent exhibitions and commissions including THE SOUL STATION, LAS, Berlin (2025) The Rebirthing Room, Studio Voltaire, London (2024); I\'m Not Doing This for the Likes, Biennale de l'Image en Mouvement, Centre d'Art Contemporain Genève, Geneva, Switzerland (2024); I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU ANYMORE, Factory International, Manchester (2023); I Can't Take This Step For You, Helsinki Biennial (2023) and Pirating Blackness, HAU Hebbel am Ufer, Berlin (2021).
