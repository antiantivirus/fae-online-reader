The purpose of this chapter is to focus a clearer lens on Creative R&D as a distinct category of art and advanced technologies (AxAT) activity. At once broadening its scope beyond association with the 'creative industries' and simultaneously creating a firm foundation for designating activity that bridges the cultural sector with innovation ecosystems.

## Creative R&D and the Creative Industries

</Box>

<Box>

Formal definitions of R&D are institutionally tethered to the natural sciences and engineering as codified in the OECD Frascati Manual---the internationally recognised guidelines for collecting and using R&D statistics.[^1] In 1976 the manual defined R&D as 'creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications'.[^2] Over time the manual has broadened its scope to account for intangible innovations in areas such as computing, acknowledging the importance of the social sciences and humanities in the development of the service industries.[^3] This framework, while robust for measuring R&D activity in science and engineering, has proved inadequate for capturing the innovation from the cultural and creative industries. Nevertheless, it has shaped government policies globally, including the UK's HMRC criteria for R&D tax relief, which still explicitly excludes the arts, humanities, and social sciences.[^4]

In 1998, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) published the Creative Industries Mapping Documents, which codified thirteen creative industries sectors and positioned them as economically significant contributors to UK GDP, valued at £60 billion annually and employing 1.4 million people.[^5] This marked a decisive shift from viewing arts and culture primarily through the lens of public subsidy and cultural value toward recognising their commercial and innovation potential.[^6] Yet, despite being celebrated for their economic contribution and innovative capacities, the creative industries remained systematically excluded from the formal R&D infrastructure that supported innovation in other sectors.

In response, the 2010 _Not Rocket Science_ report made a strong case for redefining R&D to include the arts and culture.[^7] The authors argued that many arts organisations already engage in activities that align with Frascati's categories of basic research, applied research, and experimental development---particularly when experimenting with digital distribution, audience engagement, or new forms of collaboration. However, this work is often excluded because its outputs are not always codified, reproducible, or framed in technological terms. They urged policymakers to rethink the science-and-technology bias in R&D frameworks and arts organisations to make their innovation processes more explicit and methodologically rigorous.

The 2015 edition of the Frascati Manual was the first to substantially address research in the arts, offering guidance on what arts-related activity could be classified as R&D.[^8] However, Bakhshi and Lomas have argued for further revisions to broaden applicability across all knowledge domains.[^9] Their research proposed a revised definition of R&D that explicitly incorporates the creation of cultural and social value, addresses forms of uncertainty specific to creative practice, and acknowledges that R&D can result in experiences or behavioural changes---not just products and technologies. This revised framing calls for recognising the legitimacy of R&D in arts, humanities, and social sciences; enabling more effective cross-domain collaboration; and measuring returns on investment with the same seriousness afforded to STEM disciplines. Their proposed unified definition maintains the Frascati's but adds dimensions including aleatory uncertainty and experience-led knowledge creation, challenging narrow interpretations of novelty, reproducibility, and systematisation that have historically excluded creative sectors.

The specific term 'Creative R&D' gained currency within the creative industries as advocates sought to bridge the gap between the economic importance of the creative industries and their lack of legibility within traditional R&D frameworks. The term served multiple strategic functions: it asserted the legitimacy of research and development activities in creative sectors, it challenged the science-and-technology bias in existing frameworks, and it provided a conceptual bridge between cultural policy and innovation policy.

While the creative industries have advanced recognition and support for R&D beyond traditional science and technology sectors, positioning Creative R&D solely within this domain creates significant limitations for its full potential and impact. Creative R&D within the creative industries has typically prioritised research in technologies associated with distribution and presentation---particularly immersive technologies and digital interfaces---while giving less attention to other technological fields.[^10] Furthermore, Creative R&D has often been situated within the 'soft' and 'downstream' aspects of innovation, focused on concept development, user experience, and design thinking that lead toward product development and go-to-market strategies. This positioning, while valuable, represents only one dimension of what Creative R&D can encompass. The broader exploratory research, critical inquiry, and social innovation aspects of Creative R&D---which may not have immediate commercial applications but which generate crucial insights about technological and cultural evolution---have received comparatively less emphasis.

## Recalibrating the Scope of Creative R&D

</Box>

<Box>

> Definitions matter and if we don\'t define and conceptually understand what we\'re doing as R&D, and if we don\'t establish criteria that recognise our work, we won\'t receive proper support.
>
> <cite>- Amy Tarr, Head of Policy & Public Affairs, Creative UK</cite>

The decoupling of 'Creative R&D' from 'creative industries' represents a necessary recalibration for understanding how experimental practices operate across diverse domains---from cultural institutions to technology companies, from independent studios to academic research labs. While creative industries have developed robust frameworks for measuring commercial success through audience engagement, market share, and revenue generation, which reflect some aspects of applied research and experimental development, Creative R&D requires a broader anchoring. This need becomes particularly salient when Creative R&D occurs at the intersection of multiple fields: e.g., artists working with biotechnology---which can involve cultural, academic and industry actors; cultural institutions developing AI capabilities---which can involve think-tanks, legal professionals and engineering teams; or, technologists exploring narrative systems---which can involve tech companies, philosophers and artists. In these contexts, \'creative\' signals not a market sector but a mode of experimental investigation that prioritises emergent possibilities over predetermined outcomes.

Creative R&D often occupies an ambiguous position---neither purely upstream nor downstream, neither exclusively hard nor soft technology.[^11] For example, artificial intelligence exemplifies this hybrid nature---requiring both foundational technical research in machine learning architectures (hard technology) and experimentation with generative systems, interaction design, and ethical frameworks (soft technology). Similarly, immersive technology development might involve both hardware innovations (display technologies, haptic systems) and experiential design (narrative structures, interaction models), requiring teams that can work across these traditionally separated domains. These inherited categories create particular challenges for activities at the intersection of culture and technology.

Furthermore, the separation of digital and cultural policy within the UK's governmental structure has created significant barriers to realising the ecosystemic potential of Creative R&D. Historically, digital policy was housed within the, then titled, Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) as part of a broader strategy to integrate technology and culture, aligning with the 2017 Digital and Industrial Strategies. These strategies envisioned the cultural sector as a testbed for technological applications, fostering new art forms, modes of engagement, and collaborations with major technology companies. This alignment facilitated logistical efficiencies and enabled cultural institutions to pioneer AxAT projects that operated at the intersection of digital innovation and cultural production.

However, in 2023, digital policy was transferred to the newly established Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT), decoupling it from cultural policy.[^12] This structural shift not only disrupted established collaborative frameworks but also compartmentalised digital innovation away from cultural strategy, hindering the flow of resources and policy coherence that previously encouraged cross-sector experimentation. This structural issue has been acknowledged, if not fully addressed, as a priority challenge in the recent Industrial Strategy Green Paper (2024).

AxAT represents a non-codified dynamic field where artistic practice intersects with technological innovation across a spectrum of sectors and domains.[^13] Creative R&D activity might include artists developing custom AI systems that challenge conventional machine learning approaches, cultural institutions establishing laboratories for experimental work with emerging technologies, as well as cross-sector collaborations that reimagine technological applications through artistic interventions. Although lacking formal recognition in policy frameworks, AxAT has emerged as a distinctive and fluid ecosystem through which advanced technologies are investigated, reimagined, and transformed into materials, media, tools and infrastructural foundations to underwrite new forms of expression, knowledge, and social engagement. AxAT can be distinguished from other artistic work by its direct investment in the development and implementation of advanced technologies, rather than a focus on art historical representation and interpretation, and other non-technology specific Creative R&D work.[^14]

Creative R&D within AxAT encompasses practices that use interdisciplinary methodologies to investigate advanced technologies, generating new knowledge and applications across cultural, social, and technological domains. Building on the OECD Frascati Manual\'s definition of research and development and Hasan Bakhshi\'s and Elizabeth Lomas' revisions, we propose the following definition:

Creative R&D as a systematic, transdisciplinary activity that investigates and develops advanced technologies through innovative methods, generating new knowledge and applications across cultural, social, and technological domains. It adheres to established R&D principles while emphasising exploratory approaches that may originate in artistic, design, and/or cultural practices.

Like all R&D, Creative R&D encompasses basic research (acquiring new insights without specific applications), applied research (investigation toward specific aims or objectives), and experimental development (creating new or improved outputs, processes, systems or services), thereby meeting the internationally recognised criteria for R&D: novelty, creativity, uncertainty, systematic process, and transferability.

- Novelty - R&D pursues new knowledge or insights.

- Creativity - based on original concepts and hypotheses that are pursued through non-routine activity.

- Uncertainty - R&D is uncertain about the final outcome. There is a broad recognition of the possibility of not achieving the intended results and negative results are considered valuable.

- Systematic process - R&D is a formal activity that is conducted in a planned way, with records kept of the process followed and the outcome.

- Transferability - R&D should result in the potential for the transfer of the new knowledge, ensuring its use and allowing others to reproduce the results.

What distinguishes Creative R&D is its capacity to operate across traditional boundaries, integrate diverse knowledge domains, and address complex challenges through approaches that complement other R&D methodologies. Its outcomes can be measured through both conventional R&D metrics and additional frameworks that capture cultural, social, and long-term impacts.

We propose to work within this existing definition in order to remain compatible with a recognised policy framework and within a definitional lineage that is legible to different communities.[^15] This approach provides a foundation for better recognition, evaluation, and support of Creative R&D activities across an ecosystem that encompasses creative industries, universities, civic, technology and cultural sectors. The success of this ecosystem is critical. As advanced technologies increasingly shape all aspects of social, economic, and political realities in profound and often unpredictable ways, Creative R&D has the capacity to ensure that their development reflects diverse societal needs.

[^10]: This is likely the result of an over-indexing of creative work in presentational or exhibitionary outputs which is indicative of the key criterion of extending 'access' to cultural works within most Arts Council England evaluative frameworks since its first whitepaper in 1965. While the political motivations around 'access' are related to keeping 'excellence' as public goods accessible to all, 'excellence' is measured in terms of audience and number of viewers, incentivising cultural works that can be audience-oriented, rather than focusing innovation on organisational or basic research.
[^11]:
    Upstream R&D, which often takes place through university research, focuses on basic research and early-stage technology development that may not have immediate commercial applications; often what is termed 'deep tech' research grounded in substantial science or engineering advances. This involves exploring foundational scientific principles, creating new technological capabilities, and investigating novel approaches that could eventually lead to marketable products. Downstream R&D, by contrast, concentrates on refining existing technologies, product development, scaling, and market implementation. In industrial contexts, there is typically, though not exclusively, an emphasis on downstream activities with clearer paths to commercialisation, while upstream activities often require subsidising through public funding or more profitable parts of the enterprise. The distinction between 'hard' and 'soft' technology reflects differences in both the nature of innovation and its measurement. Hard technology R&D involves physical systems, that is hardware, materials science, and manufacturing processes---areas where innovation is more readily quantifiable through patents, technical specifications, and manufacturing metrics. Soft technology R&D encompasses software development, user interface design, service innovations, and experiential technologies where outcomes are often less tangible and more difficult to measure using traditional R&D frameworks. While hard technology development has historically received more recognition within industrial R&D tax incentives and funding schemes, soft technology innovations increasingly drive economic value and user adoption.

    [^14]: Arts Council England positions \'Creative R&D\' in relation to its vast remit to support all creative practices, defining Creative R&D in grants guidance as 'developing a new idea or exploring a new way of working. While inclusive, this approach does not align with recognised definitions, and risks isolating cultural contributions with a more clearly defined Creative R&D agenda from recognition within wider innovation ecosystems. ACE\'s current work on an inclusive innovation framework valuably identifies a number of public value contributions from culture in order to make a more robust argument for Creative R&D and innovation in the arts. Still, AxAT practices, and other technologically-engaged subsectors, require frameworks that are specifically optimised for technically-intensive creative work.
