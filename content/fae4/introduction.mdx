AI technologies promise to affect nearly every aspect of our lives.<Footnote>This is a footnote</Footnote> Knowing that this transformation will play out on a societal scale requires governance and ownership mechanisms that entitle a plurality of voices to steer AI not simply as a new category of tech products, but as a public resource and infrastructure.[^2] In democratic societies, the latter are subject to varying degrees of ‘publicness’ through (1) accessibility for use, (2) maintenance as a matter of public responsibility, and (3) accountability to the public in their function. Additionally, (4) participation in strategic decisions about the development and application of resources, and (5) how the value that is derived from these resources is distributed, constitute ‘thicker’ notions of publicness, which are typically harder to render public.[^3]

Within complex innovation systems both public and private investments flow into research and development. Instead of understanding ‘public’ and ‘private’ as binary conditions attached to specific types of intermediaries (i.e. state versus market actors), FAE proposes to regard the notion of publicness as a spectrum on which the terms of public agency are negotiated, ranging from ‘thin’ to ‘thick’. ‘Thick’ public governance might apply to state-run assets funded by taxes, while ‘thin’ publicness could be obtained when/where infrastructures are freely accessible to the public but are privately owned. Between these extremes, frameworks such as commoning could be deployed to pool resources offering greater access and maintenance buy-in.[^4] Mission-driven public-private partnerships, such as those developed to build national supercomputing capabilities, leverage state-level accountability and strategic development while cooperating with private industry to deliver specialty products and services.[^5]<sup>, </sup>[^6] Non-governmental interest organisations, academia, and grassroots movements also operate within this ecosystem to address unmet needs, both structurally and on behalf of specifically affected communities.[^7]

Today’s AI is constituted through an entanglement of resources and infrastructures, each layer possessing its own context and openings for incorporating publicness into its design. What follows is the mapping of entanglements through AI’s technical stack, consisting of seven hierarchical layers organised in two tiers. First, the ‘Hardware’ tier which provides the physical material and machinery by means of Natural Resource, Server Networks and Compute layers. These enable the transfer and processing of information in the second tier: Software, from the Data layer, to the Model, Network Protocols and Application layers. By zooming in on the stack layers, the interdependence between industry, states, non-governmental organisations, academia, and the many publics that are implicated in the creation and adoption of AI can be understood, highlighting the fact that ‘public AI’ is not just a speculative category, but a reality that requires ongoing development and support.[^8]

## Software tier

### Application layer
Applications in the context of this AI stack are software products that utilise
machine learning models as a core part of their capability; for example, content
creation services such as Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT, or Suno.ai. Other
present-day applications include virtual assistants (e.g. Apple’s Siri),
recommendation systems (e.g. those used by Netflix), developer tools for writing
code (Github’s CoPilot), speech and language recognition tools (e.g. Google
Translate), biometric identification technology (e.g. fingerprint recognition
AppLock), computer sensing and simulation systems (e.g. as those operated by
driverless vehicles like CARLA), search engines (e.g. Google Search and Bing),
and others.

While the release of ChatGPT in November 2022 captured the public’s imagination, the history of applications that use different underlying AI capabilities (or precursors to AI) spans decades.[^9] Companies are, by default, incentivised to develop commercial products for consumers; however, governments, non-profits, and individuals also develop their own applications. For instance, in the UK the National Health Service develops applications for doctors to more accurately detect diseases using patient data.[^10] However, applications developed by the public sector are not always state-owned. Sometimes they are developed privately and licensed to the public sector. Regardless, privacy and consent are rights that are intrinsic to the individual irrespective of whether or not the tool is developed by the public sector, private sector, or state-owned.[^11]
