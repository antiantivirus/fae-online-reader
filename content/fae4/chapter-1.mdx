The concept of ‘organisation’ both refers to an entity––an organisation––acting in pursuit of a set of goals, but the term also refers to the process of organising. Every new technical advancement in information-gathering, processing and circulation has created affordances and challenges for how organisation is structured as a process, and what it enables; think of the telegraph, the printing press, the digital computer, the internet. That the dominant form of organisation today is achieved through techno-social units that persist across geographies and generations is in large part owed to the aforementioned technologies. The confrontation of the AI stack with the du jour systems of organisation has the capacity to inaugurate a new chapter in how organisations function, how they are structured, their daily operations and their mandates, as well as in the more fundamental sense of what kinds of societies they enable.

While ‘culture’ is something that happens everywhere all the time within societies, what becomes recognised as culture is a result of collective recognition through the variable lenses of community, audience, and nation. In most democratic societies, the cultural sector is positioned in the role of organisational mediator mirroring a collective recognition in its historical, contemporary and future-oriented forms, and transforms that recognition into a resource with, at the very least, a thin notion of publicness attached to it (i.e. access). More generally, cultural institutions conserve and generate meaning through the information encapsulated by their collections, archives, and activities. At the same time, new types of cultural organisations emerge to attend to new societal needs and conditions. When culture is deeply imbricated with information flows and digital interfaces at every scale, cultural organisations are, at once, users and producers of advanced technological societies, investors and investees in its social and economic affordances.

At present, the cultural sector might not figure as a prominent space for determining how AI shapes, and will be shaped by, host societies. However, its role as an organisational mediator of collective cultural recognition inadvertently makes it the most critical, and least obvious, battlefield for the advance of AI as an existentially and operationally transformative technology. To understand why that is so, and how that role can be performed with greater strategic acumen and direction; it is necessary to attend to how the core elements of today’s AI, – DATA, MODEL

and COMPUTE, – are recoding what organisations are and can be across the cultural space. This chapter highlights the different emerging fronts that present-day cultural institutions should be aware of as they face questions concerning the manner in which their identity, mission, and operational frameworks dovetail with questions of AI’s publicness.
