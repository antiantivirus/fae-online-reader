**CROSSLUCID**

is an artist collective (est. 2018) that engages in highly collaborative, cross-disciplinary projects in co-evolution with technology.

Their work and research includes the exploration of the self as a network, emerging forms of intimacy, and the potential for pleasurable actualisation throughout the digital sphere, as well as reimagining our alliances with technology as expressions of a sympoietic biosphere and a universal post-material consciousness.

Through explorations spanning filmmaking, poetic artificial intelligence, multi-layered techniques of collage, assemblage, and experience-led interventions they create scenarios and build experiential formats that instigate prototyping and the rehearsing of potential futures and metamodern values.
